Description:

Field jdbcTemplate in com.santander.bnc.bsn021.bncbsn021gemotorbackend.service.impl.MarcacionClienteOperacionServiceImpl required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- gemotorJdbcTemplate: defined by method 'gemotorJdbcTemplate' in class path resource [com/santander/bnc/bsn021/bncbsn021gemotorbackend/config/GemotorConfig.class]
	- goldenJdbcTemplate: defined by method 'goldenJdbcTemplate' in class path resource [com/santander/bnc/bsn021/bncbsn021gemotorbackend/config/GoldenConfig.class]

This may be due to missing parameter name information

Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Ensure that your compiler is configured to use the '-parameters' flag.
You may need to update both your build tool settings as well as your IDE.
